# Analysis Plan 

## Aim: To understand patterns of ongoing thought in the exteroceptive and interoceptive groups at baseline and posttraining. 

### To achieve this, need to have _one row per thought-probe_. Columns will be different questions, as well as a column coding for timepoint (baseline = 0, posttraining = 1) and group (exteroceptive = 0, interoceptive = 1). 

### The data will come from 1) mrimwq - modified york mind-wandering questions done after the scan and (?) 2) nback - questions asked during/after (?) the n-back task
